She lives with diabetes and left school in 2021, and is currently unemployed, which has affected her confidence and self-esteem. Despite these challenges, she is motivated and is currently studying to become a pre-school teaching assistant, a field she is passionate about and naturally skilled in. A laptop would greatly support her studies and help her work towards a stable and fulfilling future working with children.
