    "description": "This is a low-income family of 4 with a child with special needs and another school-going child. Father is the sole breadwinner of the family. Mother is the main caregiver to the child with special needs who requires support in most activities of his daily living. The child requires daily use of a few diapers and the total cost of it can add up to a significant amount so it has been difficult for the family to build savings. The provision of diapers would help alleviate their financial stressors. Please contact me via email if you are keen to support this family. Thank you!",
