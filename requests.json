She usually earns enough for the family, and the family is on financial assistance as well. However, as mother has been sick this month and was even hospitalized (overwork), the family is experiecing financial difficulties (mum works as a sales person and if she does not work and earn commision, she does not earn enough for the family). Husband is trying to look for a part-time job, but that will take some time too. FSC has provided them with some emergency cash this month for their basic needs but they need some support for diapers. They have 2 young children still on diapers and it would be helpful if they can get 4 packets of L and XL diapers each for each child (any brand is fine). This should last them for 1 month plus till mother feels better and the family's financial situation stabilises a bit. It would be helpful if they can get a few tins of Lactogen 3 too as the current tins that they have can only last for a few more weeks. Thank you for supporting the family, please feel free to reach out to me through email should you require more information.",
