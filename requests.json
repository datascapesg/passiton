    "description": "This family was displaced due to ongoing family issues and had to seek temporary shelter. Despite being born with a blood condition that makes injuries potentially dangerous, the father continues to work long hours to support his family. He is deeply committed to his children’s well-being, ensuring they attend school regularly and have their daily necessities met. The father is a strong self-advocate and remains focused on securing the best possible future for his family, even in the face of current challenges. With perseverance, the family has successfully obtained a rental flat and is now in the process of rebuilding stability. They are currently seeking donations for essential household items to help them settle into their new home, specifically a queen sized bed, cupboard and drawers. The support would go a long way in helping this family start anew with dignity and comfort.",
