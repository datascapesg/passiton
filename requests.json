She also just placed her child in infant care so there is some transition for the family at the moment. They used to be on financial assistance but now that they have a stable to stay, the couple aims to work to provide for their little family. However, finances are still tight for them as they just moved in and spent some money moving in. They would need a fridge so that they can store food inside as they cook to save money. This couple is a Muslim couple, so it would be helpful if the preloved but good working condition fridge has not put pork related food items inside before or if a donor could provide them with a new fridge.
