The family’s eczema symptoms tend to worsen when exposed to mould and harsh cleaning chemicals. This creates a cycle of discomfort and stress for both mother and children.\n\nNeed:\nTo maintain a clean, skin-safe environment, Madam K requires:\n• Gentle, eczema-friendly cleaning materials (e.g., non-fragranced detergents, gloves, mild surface cleaners)\n• Anti-mould products suitable for sensitive skin environments\n\nIntended Outcome:\nWith these supplies and supports, Madam K will be able to:\n• Reduce mould and allergen exposure in the home\n• Minimise eczema flare-ups for herself and her children\n• Improve the family’s comfort, sleep quality, and overall well-being\n• Foster a healthier living environment conducive to long-term skin management\n\nRequest:\nWe seek donor support to provide:\n• Anti-mould and eczema-safe cleaning products(for toilet)\n• Replacement of cleaning tools (e.g., gloves, mop heads, gentle disinfectants)\n\nClosing Statement:\nYour contribution will directly improve this family’s living conditions and health.

She was just discharged from the halfway house a few months ago, realising that her washing machine is broken. She is working round the clock providing for her daughter and herself and is unable to handwash her clothes. Her daughter, who is a full-time student and on a nursing internship has little to no time to wash clothes as well. Without this essential appliance, she struggles to maintain proper hygiene whilst job searching and caring for her daughter. Any working washing machine would be greatly appreciated and would significantly help this family rebuild their lives.",

Despite her health challenges, she continues to support her children, ensuring their daily needs are met and that they remain under stable care.\n\nCurrent Situation:\nMadam S works 2 to 4 days a week, on alternating day (9 a.m. – 9 p.m.) and night (9 p.m. – 9 a.m.) shifts, to provide for her family. Her irregular working hours and ongoing dialysis treatments significantly limit her income and physical stamina. She has no regular partner support and relies mainly on her own effort, with occasional help from friends and relatives who assist in caring for her children during her dialysis sessions and work shifts.\n\nNeed:\nA blood glucose monitoring machine would greatly support Madam S in managing her diabetes more effectively between dialysis sessions. Currently, she does not have a reliable way to monitor her blood sugar levels at home, which puts her at higher risk for hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic episodes.\n\nIntended Outcome:\nWith access to a blood glucose monitor and test strips, Madam S will be able to:\n• Track her blood sugar levels regularly and adjust her diet or medication accordingly.\n• Better manage her condition, reducing complications and hospital admissions.\n• Maintain stability for her children through improved health and fewer medical disruptions.\n\nRequest:\nWe seek support to provide:\n• One (1) blood glucose monitoring device\n• Lancets and test strips (minimum 6 months’ supply)\n• Alcohol wipes\n\nClosing Statement:\nMadam S exemplifies quiet strength and determination in the face of chronic illness and caregiving responsibilities. Your contribution will not only meet an immediate medical need but also affirm her effort to remain a caring and self-reliant mother despite the challenges she faces.",
