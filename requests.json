They are also unable to tap on their extended relatives for financial support as they have their own financial difficulties as well. However, the current comcare assistance amount is insufficient for the family's basic needs as it did not account for the newborn's needs. The hospital is also unable to help with milk and diapers for the newborn. As such, we are hoping that a kind donor could support the family with 4 packets of Huggies Platinum Justborn Tape Diapers 24pcs and 2 tins of Nestle Lactogen 1 Infant Milk Formula 1.8kg, for them to last for the baby's first month. If you would like support with the newborn's milk and diapers for the next 2-3 months too, you can let me know, as the family would need some time to stabilise themselves too, with the arrival of the newborn. I have pictures of the milk and diapers baby is using now. Please feel free to email me during office hours. Thank you so much for your help!",
