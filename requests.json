The family is currently fully dependent on Comcare assistance as client was unable to work due to her pregnancy and her fiancé was unable to work too due to a run in with the law. They are also unable to tap on their extended relatives for financial support as they have their own financial difficulties as well. However, the current comcare assistance amount is insufficient for the family's basic needs as it did not account for the newborn's needs. The family had to buy milk and diapers for the new born, which was more expensive, and as such, could not afford to buy milk and diapers for their toddler. As such, we are hoping that a kind donor could support the family with 4 packets of Drypers size L and 3 tins of Nestle Lactogen 2 1.8kg, for them to last for about 1 month plus while they try to apply for other assistance for support. If you would like support with the family's milk and diapers for the next 2-3 months too, you can let me know, as the family would need some time to stabilise themselves too, with the arrival of the newborn. Please feel free to contact me during office hours. Thank you so much for your help!",
