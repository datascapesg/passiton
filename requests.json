She usually cooks indian dishes and heavily relies on the blender which has recently spoilt. Senior has not been employed for many years due to limited physical mobility, hence has financial constraints in replacing the blender. This is the sample of the blender: https://shp.ee/gmnnupu , or any kind of blender donation is appreciated. It will be great if the item can be delivered to Ang Mo Kio area. Feel free to contact Emily at 8368 6285, thank you very much:)",

    "description": "Client has a large family with 5 young children. The family has high living expenses, and client's husband is the sole breadwinner of the family. Husband's pay is insufficient to provide for the children's needs. Their Comcare assistance had been rejected lately but family is still struggling - pending for other assistance to get back to them. Client is still unable to work at the moment as she needs to monitor her teenage daughter due to her high flight risk and pending case with police and child protection. The children were continuously sick in the past few months which father then has to come back to care for the younger kids too and this impacts his income. Finances are very tight for them and it would be very helpful if a donor could provide the family with some milk powder and diapers for the next 3 months to ease their financial burden and ensure their younger kids' basic needs are still met. The family requires 3 tins of S26 Stage 3 and 2 packets of Dugro Stage 4 for 2 of their children. They also require 3 XL and 3 XXL Huggies Diapers (Tape). Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me too, and you can donate any amount that you are comfortable with, and it can be a one-off help too. Thank you very much for helping the family!",
