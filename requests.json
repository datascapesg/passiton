The family has high living expenses, and parents' low income is not sufficient to provide for the children's basic needs and due to medical emergencies this month, they are unable to buy enough milk and diapers for the family. Finances are very tight for them and it would be very helpful if a donor could provide the family with some milk powder and diapers for this month to ease their financial burden and ensure their younger kids' basic needs are still met while waiting for the assistance we applied for them for milk and diapers for the children to be approved. The family requires 2 tins of Grow Stage 3 1.6kg and 2 packets of Dugro Stage 4 for 2 of their children. They also require 6 packets of XXL Huggies Silver Pantz. Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me too, and you can donate any amount that you are comfortable with. Thank you very much for helping the family!",

She usually earns enough for the family, and the family is on financial assistance as well. However, as mother has been sick this month and was even hospitalized (overwork), the family is experiecing financial difficulties (mum works as a sales person and if she does not work and earn commision, she does not earn enough for the family). Husband is trying to look for a part-time job, but that will take some time too. FSC has provided them with some emergency cash this month for their basic needs but they need some support for diapers. They have 2 young children still on diapers and it would be helpful if they can get 4 packets of L and XL diapers each for each child (any brand is fine). This should last them for 1 month plus till mother feels better and the family's financial situation stabilises a bit. It would be helpful if they can get a few tins of Lactogen 3 too as the current tins that they have can only last for a few more weeks. Thank you for supporting the family, please feel free to reach out to me through email should you require more information.",
