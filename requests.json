The parents run a school canteen stall which is the main source of income. Recently, their fridge (which is essential for storing the fresh ingredients they use daily) broke down. Without it, food preparation for the stall has become very difficult, and their ability to earn is directly impacted. It is especially challenging during school holidays when the stall is closed, and there is no income at all.  Fridge model to be used at home for the food business. It needs sufficient storage space and cooling capacity (3 ticks for energy efficiency otherwise will incur high utility bills). The family is unable to afford a replacement fridge and unable to fix the spoilt fridge. Your donation will help ease their daily struggles and empower this family to keep going.",
