Currently, husband's pay is insufficient to provide for the children's needs. The family has been trying to get back on their feet again and has stopped getting financial assistance. However, finances is still tight for them as mum only just started work and it would be very helpful if a donor could provide the family with some milk powder and diapers for the next 1-2 months to ease their financial burden and ensure their younger kids' basic needs are still met. The family requires 3 tins of S26 Stage 3 and 3 XL and 3 XXL Huggies Diapers (Pantz) per month. Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me too, and you can donate any amount that you are comfortable with, and it can be a one-off help too. Thank you very much for helping the family!",
