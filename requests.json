It would be very helpful if a donor could provide her with 3 green packets of 850g Dugro Original Stage 3 milk powder (client claims that this milk can be found at UStar Supermarket or Shopee) and 3 packets of Drypantz XL Baby Diapers - 32s (9 - 14kg) to meet her child's basic needs February 2023 as their current supply will run out early that month. This will give her some time to find a better paying job and apply for NECDC Growth Fund for assistance for milk and diapers for her youngest child. Feel free to contact me for more information about the milk and diapers (I can provide the pictures). I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me.
