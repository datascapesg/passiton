The father is actively searching for work, and the mother, who is pregnant, is shouldering the responsibility of caring for their young children under challenging circumstances. Presently, the family alternates between handwashing clothes and using coin-operated laundry services, as their washing machine has broken down. This ongoing situation not only adds to their financial burdens but also places physical strain on the pregnant mother, who is already managing the demands of young children and pregnancy. A washing machine would significantly reduce both their laundry costs and the physical strain on the mother. It would also allow the family to allocate their limited resources towards other essential household needs, while providing the father with the opportunity to focus on securing stable, full-time employment. We kindly request your support in providing a washing machine to help ease the family’s daily struggles and contribute to their efforts to build a more stable and healthier future.",
