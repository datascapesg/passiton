Client has recently been diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension, and will be undergoing a gall bladder removal, pending clearance from her doctor as her hypertension is unmanaged and might pose as a medical risk. Her husband is currently unemployed, as he has been diagnosed with pre-cardiac condition and severe psoriasis. As such, the family are limited in their financial resources and are unable to replace the wall fan in their home which previously fused and burned. This has resulted in the house being warm and stuffy, especially on rainy days where they have needed to keep the windows closed. In addition, on days that it is humid, the family would leave the main door open, resulting in an increased lack of safety for the family and children.",

Her partner just started working as grab food delivery rider to bring home some income for the family. She is still trying to find a job but has some difficulties due to her educational qualifications. She also just placed her child in infant care so there is some transition for the family at the moment. They used to be on financial assistance but now that they have a stable to stay, the couple aims to work to provide for their little family. However, finances are still tight for them as they just moved in and spent some money moving in. They would need a fridge so that they can store food inside as they cook to save money. This couple is a Muslim couple, so it would be helpful if the preloved but good working condition fridge has not put pork related food items inside before or if a donor could provide them with a new fridge. Thank you so much for supporting this family!",
