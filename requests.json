They previously had a bedbug infestation in their home and, with the generous help of donors, received two sets of sofas. Unfortunately, the fumigation was not done properly, and both sofas have become infested again. These sofas will be disposed of, leaving them to sit only on hard wooden dining chairs in the meantime.\n\nThe wife is not mobile and requires a walking frame even at home, while the husband walks with a limp and pushes his wife in a wheelchair whenever they go out. They have no children and rely on government support schemes (ComCare) for their daily needs.\n\nA new round of fumigation is currently underway, with an inspection scheduled for Friday, 22 August to confirm the home is bedbug-free. For safety, we would kindly request that any sofa delivery take place after 22 August, once clearance is confirmed.\n\nLeather sofas are preferred as they are easier to maintain and less prone to pest issues, and light colours are requested for better visibility and cleanliness.\n\nYour kindness and generosity will bring them not only comfort but also dignity in their daily living. Thank you for considering this request.\nPlease contact me @ 8518 3526 via whatsapp.",
