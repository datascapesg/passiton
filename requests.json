Recently, she has some urine incontinence issue and unknowingly peed heavily on her whole mattress and she had to throw it away as she could not salvage it. As such, now she sleeps on the floor with her blanket as she has no money to buy a new one and has back issues. It would be very helpful if a kind donor can purchase a new super single or single sized mattress for her or if you have a second hand mattress in good working condition and is relatively clean, please feel free to contact me through email for more information to see how we can help the family.
