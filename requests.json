Husband's pay is insufficient to provide for the children's needs. Client is still unable to work at the moment as she is caring full-time for her youngest (1 years old) and they have difficulties placing her in infant care. The children were continuously sick in the past few months, with 1 child admitted to KKH each month. As such, parents are unable to work as they need to care for them and there is barely any income. They are also working with CPS about their teenage daughter. Finances are very tight for them and it would be very helpful if a donor could provide the family with some milk powder and diapers for the next 3 months to ease their financial burden and ensure their younger kids' basic needs are still met. The family requires 3 tins of S26 Stage 3 and 2 packets of Dugro Stage 4 for 2 of their children. They also require 3 XL and 3 XXL Huggies Diapers (Tape). Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me too, and you can donate any amount that you are comfortable with, and it can be a one-off help too. Thank you very much for helping the family!",
