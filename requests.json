NF assaulted her and threw her phone until it spoilt. NM has applied for an EO against NF on 28 October 2025. \n\nAs such, NM needs a new phone as she has: \n1. Lost her physical IC and needs her singpass \n2. Only recently applied for a bank account and the bank card is not available yet. Hence, her transactions are done through ibanking currently, which she needs her phone for. Even when the card is ready in about a week's time, she will unlikely have time to head to the bank TPY branch to collect it. \n3. To remain in contact with FSC worker and CPSC worker while she takes shelter at relative's house and at the crisis shelter. To contact police if she coincidentally meets NF again and she or the children are in danger. \n4. To remain at the crisis shelter, she will need to manage her own expenses, which requires a phone.\n\n\nPlease whatsapp me @ 8907 8297 if you wish to help this family. Thank you!",

Despite her health challenges, she continues to support her children, ensuring their daily needs are met and that they remain under stable care.\n\nCurrent Situation:\nMadam S works 2 to 4 days a week, on alternating day (9 a.m. – 9 p.m.) and night (9 p.m. – 9 a.m.) shifts, to provide for her family. Her irregular working hours and ongoing dialysis treatments significantly limit her income and physical stamina. She has no regular partner support and relies mainly on her own effort, with occasional help from friends and relatives who assist in caring for her children during her dialysis sessions and work shifts.\n\nNeed:\nA blood glucose monitoring machine would greatly support Madam S in managing her diabetes more effectively between dialysis sessions. Currently, she does not have a reliable way to monitor her blood sugar levels at home, which puts her at higher risk for hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic episodes.\n\nIntended Outcome:\nWith access to a blood glucose monitor and test strips, Madam S will be able to:\n• Track her blood sugar levels regularly and adjust her diet or medication accordingly.\n• Better manage her condition, reducing complications and hospital admissions.\n• Maintain stability for her children through improved health and fewer medical disruptions.\n\nRequest:\nWe seek support to provide:\n• One (1) blood glucose monitoring device\n• Lancets and test strips (minimum 6 months’ supply)\n• Alcohol wipes\n\nClosing Statement:\nMadam S exemplifies quiet strength and determination in the face of chronic illness and caregiving responsibilities. Your contribution will not only meet an immediate medical need but also affirm her effort to remain a caring and self-reliant mother despite the challenges she faces.",
