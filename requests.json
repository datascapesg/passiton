Teenage daughter just moved back home from a children's home in the past few months and the family is still adjusting to living with one another. Its helpful to have the TV at home so that they can bond together during TV time and they have limited devices. The family's TV recently broke down and mother does not have enough money to buy a new one due to tight finances. It would be helpful if a kind donor could donate a preloved (but good working condition) or new one for this family. Please feel free to send me pictures of your tv if you have any and I will check with the family if its suitable at home. It would be great if donor could get someone to assist with installation (with wires) if needed. Thank you so much!",
