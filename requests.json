At present, the family does not possess any source of income, having previously operated a home-based cookie business that had to be ceased recently due to the mother’s illness, which has rendered her unable to work for several months. \n\nAs the main caregiver for her children and grandchildren, the mother relies on her mobile phone to address various educational matters, engage with relevant stakeholders, and access essential applications such as SingPass, CPF, Whatsapp, Bank applications, etc. Unfortunately, her current phone has malfunctioned, resulting in her inability to be contacted. Acquiring a new phone would greatly enhance her access to important systems and enable her to better meet the needs of her family.",

Currently, parents are trying to get their oldest daughter to start working (she is 16 and dropped out of school) so that the family's finances can be more stable. However, they are unable to buy enough milk and diapers for now as finances are very tight for them and it would be very helpful if a donor could provide the family with some milk powder and diapers for about 2 months to ease their financial burden and ensure their younger kids' basic needs are still met while they work out some plans to stabilize the family financially. The family requires 5 tins of Grow Stage 3 900g and 2 packets of Dugro Stage 4 for 2 of their children. They also require 3 packets each of XL and XXL Huggies Silver Pantz. Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me too, and you can donate any amount that you are comfortable with.
