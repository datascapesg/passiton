Client is currently unemployed but attending courses to upgrade her skills so that she can get a better paying job after. Recently, client received a good news that she has been shortlisted for the Management Trainee program. As her laptop has stopped working, she had to resort to using her phone to go for the courses. However, some assignments requires client to use a laptop instead. This caused client to have to reschedule some of her courses and will eventually decrease her efficiency and motivation to work to earn money for her family.",
