Client's wife is also retired and is not drawing an income presently. Client's son that is living with him is unemployed due to his intellectual disability. Hence as a result the mattresses used by client and his son is old, soiled and has not been changed for a considerable amount of time. Stains can be seen on the mattress which is not healthy for the family in the long run. Having a new Single Bed mattress for the father and son will be very helpful for them financially and health wise in improving the quality of life of the family. It would be greatly appreciated if a few simple pillow cases and mattress sheets can be donated to client and son as well so that the covers can be washed frequently to maintain hygiene. Thank you!",
