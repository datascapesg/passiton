My client is on public assistance for his basic needs and is unable to afford a new wardrobe. \n\nHaving a stable and functional wardrobe would greatly improve his safety and quality of life.",

    "description": "We’re reaching out to support a mum who is doing everything she can for her family. She is the primary caregiver for three young children (ages 1–4), one of whom is her niece, and also cares for her teenage niece, all while expecting her third child. Her husband works long hours as a delivery driver and is the sole breadwinner, but the family is struggling financially.\nTo make outings safer and more manageable, she hopes to get a double stroller for her 1-year-old and newborn. This simple item would make a big difference in her daily life, helping her care for the children with less stress and more ease.\n \nThese were the two strollers she sent me. Both of them are from the brand: Joie. The one on the left is the Joie Evalite Duo Double Stroller, and the one on the right is Joie Aire Twin Double Baby Stroller.",
