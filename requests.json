The family requires 4 tins of S26 Stage 3 1.6kg and 2 packets of Dugro Stage 4 for their children. They also require 6 packets of XXL Huggies Silver Pantz. The milk is more urgent as family still has some diapers at home. Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me too, and you can donate any amount that you are comfortable with (you can order online for it to be sent to the family). Thank you very much for helping the family!",

She has limited mobility as well and requires a walking frame to walk. As the washing machine is spoilt, mother is unable to wash clothes properly (unable to bend her back to wash and daughter is usually only back home at night and unable to wash much). They hope to receive some support for a preloved but good working condition washing machine (with installation support) so that they can get back to their normal routines at home.
