Despite her health challenges, she continues to support her children, ensuring their daily needs are met and that they remain under stable care.\n\nCurrent Situation:\nMadam S works 2 to 4 days a week, on alternating day (9 a.m. – 9 p.m.) and night (9 p.m. – 9 a.m.) shifts, to provide for her family. Her irregular working hours and ongoing dialysis treatments significantly limit her income and physical stamina. She has no regular partner support and relies mainly on her own effort, with occasional help from friends and relatives who assist in caring for her children during her dialysis sessions and work shifts.\n\nNeed:\nA blood glucose monitoring machine would greatly support Madam S in managing her diabetes more effectively between dialysis sessions. Currently, she does not have a reliable way to monitor her blood sugar levels at home, which puts her at higher risk for hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic episodes.\n\nIntended Outcome:\nWith access to a blood glucose monitor and test strips, Madam S will be able to:\n• Track her blood sugar levels regularly and adjust her diet or medication accordingly.\n• Better manage her condition, reducing complications and hospital admissions.\n• Maintain stability for her children through improved health and fewer medical disruptions.\n\nRequest:\nWe seek support to provide:\n• One (1) blood glucose monitoring device\n• Lancets and test strips (minimum 6 months’ supply)\n• Alcohol wipes\n\nClosing Statement:\nMadam S exemplifies quiet strength and determination in the face of chronic illness and caregiving responsibilities.
