It would be very helpful if a donor could provide her with 4 green packets of 850g Dugro Original Stage 4 milk powder (client claims that this milk can be found at UStar Supermarket or Shopee) and 4 packets of Drypantz XL Baby Diapers - 42s (12-17kg) to meet her child's basic needs for this 1-2 months as their current supply will run out early that month. This will give her some time to find a better paying job. Feel free to contact me for more information about the milk and diapers (I can provide the pictures). I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. If you don't mind helping them for up to 3 months, that would be very helpful too but please feel free to donate any amount that you are comfortable with. Feel free to email me for more details.

    "description": "This family currently has 5 young children, including a newborn. One of their sons recently got hospitalized into KKH as he injured his ankle, which has spread to his thighs and knees. Doctor shared that he needs this cast to aid in his recovery and allevaite the pain. He currently experiences pain while walking and has not been going to school for the past month and would have to sit in a trolley to be transported around. However, the family is currently facing tight finances and fully dependent on Comcare assistance as mother is still recovering from giving birth not long ago. Her fiancé is also unable to work too due to a run in with the law. They are also unable to tap on their extended relatives for financial support as they have their own financial difficulties as well. The family does not have enough money to get this item for their 8 year old and hopes that a kind donor can provide this item for his knee to heal properly. Please feel free to reach out to me for more information if needed. Thank you so much for helping this family!",
