    "description": "We are seeking a hospital bed table for a care recipient who is currently bedbound and undergoing dialysis treatment. The table will greatly assist him in performing daily activities, particularly during mealtimes, as he is confined to bed while recovering at home.\n\nThe care recipient’s primary caregiver is his partner, who is also a senior. Both are retirees with limited financial resources and do not have additional family support. Providing them with a hospital bed table would significantly enhance the care recipient’s comfort and ease the caregiver’s responsibilities.\n\nWe would be deeply appreciative if anyone could donate a hospital bed table in good condition to support this couple’s caregiving needs.",
