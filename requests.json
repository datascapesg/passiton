Her previous mobile phone, which was also a donated device, stopped working several months ago, and there are no free repair services available in Singapore. She is unable to afford a new smartphone. However, because many functions now require a mobile phone, and at the same time, due to not having a mobile phone, social workers and various social service personnel are unable to directly contact client, not having a mobile phone has caused various inconveniences in her daily life.\nWe kindly request your consideration in offering a mobile phone to the client, which would greatly enhance the ability to connect with various social services, seek necessary assistance, and improve her overall well-being.\nPlease WhatsApp Hsin Yu at 89118058 or email to hsinyu_lee@viriya.org.sg to liaise.",

The children were continuously sick in the past few months, with 1 child admitted to KKH each month. As such, parents are unable to work as they need to care for them and there is barely any income. They are also working with CPS about their teenage daughter. Finances are very tight for them and it would be very helpful if a donor could provide the family with some milk powder and diapers for the next 3 months to ease their financial burden and ensure their younger kids' basic needs are still met. The family requires 3 tins of S26 Stage 3 and 2 packets of Dugro Stage 4 for 2 of their children. They also require 3 XL and 3 XXL Huggies Diapers (Tape). Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me too, and you can donate any amount that you are comfortable with, and it can be a one-off help too. Thank you very much for helping the family!",
