The family requires 4 tins of S26 Stage 3 1.6kg and 2 packets of Dugro Stage 4 for their children. They also require 6 packets of XXL Huggies Silver Pantz. The milk is more urgent as family still has some diapers at home. Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours.

Apart from that she also has ongoing mental health needs, and to cope she has three cats that are resources for her to cope with her circumstances. Client would benefit from having a pet vacuum that can help pick up cat litter pellets, as she prioritises her cats’ wellbeing greatly but finds it increasingly challenging to keep up with ensuring home environment’s hygiene due to her deteriorating health. Thus having this would help her greatly in upkeeping her rental flat, as well as managing her physical health.Interested donors kindly contact Alexis at 6365 8751, thank you!",
