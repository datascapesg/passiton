Husband's pay is insufficient to provide for the children's needs. Client is still unable to work at the moment as she is caring full-time for her youngest (1 years old) and they have difficulties placing her in infant care. The home's wardrobes (1 big 1 small) has spoilt i.e. doors r spoilt, cracks, peeling) and client does not have enough money at the moment to buy new wardrobes. It would be very helpful if a donor could provide her with new wardrobes, or preloved one in good working condition in time for Hari Raya (if possible). Client prefers a new one but FSC has tried to manage her expectations. Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me.
