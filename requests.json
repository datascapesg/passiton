He has multiple appointments a month in SGH for treatments and review, covered with MediFund. As he is both an introvert and an orphan, he is relying solely on his own savings and government payouts; he does not have friends who can help. \n\nWe are requesting for a water heater so that he may have warm water to shower, especially during the rainy season.",
