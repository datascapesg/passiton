Client's husband is the sole breadwinner and is working ad-hoc to earn immediate cash to try to meet their basic needs and juggles to help support client in the caregiving. Their family of origin are struggling financially with financial debts and medical conditions, thus unable to provide financial support to them. The family has expressed motivation to work towards financial and employment stability and hence would require interim support for a washing machine to assist in their present financial struggles. Thank you!",
