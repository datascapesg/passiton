    "description": "Client is has cancer patient and under our palliative care service. She hopes to get this lightweight oxygen concentrator to be able to go out with her family and friends on longer outings as these are precious quality time to her and activities she used to enjoy and really looked forward to in the past as a cancer patient for several years.  She is unable to go out for longer period of time now due to breathlessness and having to be dependent on oxygen machine as the cancer has progressed; currently, she has to bring a portable oxygen tank out which is heavy and can only last for 3 hours (has to be refilled and replaced once oxygen is used up).  This lightweight o2 concentrator can be charged and need not be refilled and replaced. She and family have difficulties affording a light weight oxygen concentrator as it is costly. Hence they are hoping to get it second hand. Refer to https://shop.lifelinecorp.com/products/freestyle-comfort-portable-oxygen-concentrator for reference Kindly contact Amanda at 84282545.",
