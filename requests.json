Client is still unable to work at the moment as she is caring full-time of her 6 month old as she is pending placement for her at an infant care. Client does not have enough money at the moment to buy a new washing machine after their current one is spoilt. It would be very helpful if a donor could provide her with either a new washing machine (can be cheap), or a preloved one in good working condition. Client prefers a new one but FSC has tried to manage her expectations. It would be very helpful to get a washing machine as the family has much laundry to do and hand washing it is very difficult for client alone to do. Feel free to contact me for more information.
