    "description": "Family has 3 school-going children. One of the children has special needs and is not independent in toileting. She also requires full-time assistance from a caregiver, who accompanies her in school daily. The family is under financial assistance and is tight on expenses. As diapers are an essential item that takes up a significant bulk of income, support through the provision of diapers would be very helpful for the family. Additionally, it would be helpful if the family could also be supported with wet wipes (any brand) to help alleviate their financial stressors. Please email me if you are keen to support this family. Thank you so much!",
