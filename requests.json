    "description": "Client, 62 years old male, lives alone in a rental flat. He has medical conditions that limit his physical mobility, hence depends on the motorised scooter to ambulate in the community. Client has not been working for about 8 years due to multiple medical conditions. The current motorised scooter has been used for more than three years and has replaced the battery for about three times. Despite replacing the battery, the motorised scooter can only lasts for at most 30 mins which client has to push back the motorised scooter at times and is taxing on his body. It will be great if the item can be delivered directly to Ang Mo Kio Ave 3. Feel free to whatsapp or call Emily at 8368 6285, thank you.",
