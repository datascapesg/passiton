    "description": "Client is an unwed young mother. She and her partner have been chased out of their cousin's place and are seeking refuge at her sister's place. The child's father is currently in NS and the family is solely dependent on the father's NS pay and some financial assistance which is barely enough for the family currently. The young couple does not have enough money to buy a new stroller for their baby (current one spoilt) and family has tight finances so unable to help her apart from letting her lodge). It would be very helpful if a kind donor could donate a preloved but good working condition or new stroller for the baby. Please feel free to reach out to me for more information. Thank you for supporting this family!",

    "description": "Client is an unwed young mother. She and her partner have been chased out of their cousin's place and are seeking refuge at her sister's place. The child's father is currently in NS and the family is solely dependent on the father's NS pay which is insufficient for the family currently.  The infant's milk will run out next week but the young couple does not have enough money to buy it as they lack family support (parents are not supportive as they disapprove of the unplanned pregnancy and sister has her own children and family has tight finances so unable to help her apart from letting her lodge). It would be very helpful if a kind donor could buy and send 4 tins of Dumex Dulac Infant Milk Formula - Step 1 800g and 4 size S packets of diapers for them to last first . Please feel free to reach out to me for more information if needed. Thank you so much!",
