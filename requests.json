Client's shift work has been greatly reduced and so her income has been reduced and finances are even tighter now. She is planning to find another better paying job, but it would take time. It would be very helpful if a donor could provide her with 3 packets of 850g Dugro Original Stage 3 milk powder and 3 packets of Drypantz XL Baby Diapers - 32s (9 - 14kg) to meet her child's basic needs each month for about 2-3 months, giving her some time to find a better paying job as its difficult due to her limited educational qualifications. Feel free to contact me for more information about the milk and diapers (I can provide the pictures). If you would like to donate one-time off, and an amount that you are comfortable with, that is fine as well. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me.
