    "description": "Atiqah is a 19 y/o girl who has been staying in Singapore Girls’ Home for 4 years under a care and protection order. She will be discharged from Girls’ Home on 30 Sep’23 and will be staying at her mother and stepfather’s house at Taman Jurong. However, the family has difficulties supporting Atiqah financially as they are barely able to meet their basic needs – her mother is a full-time caregiver of 3 other children (4yo, 9yo and 16yo) while her stepfather is the sole breadwinner earning a gross monthly salary of about $2k. The family is not eligible to apply financial assistance to support Atiqah’s needs as she has yet to be discharged from Girls’ Home. As Atiqah will be enrolled in a work-skills training program for 6 months, she will not be earning any income to support herself.\nAtiqah’s family will greatly appreciate sponsorship for the following items to enable her stable reintegration into the community.",
