Client does not have enough cash at the moment to buy diapers for her baby, and it will run out by tonight. But I have shared with her that donors may not be able to help her so quickly given that her request was quite rushed. It would be very helpful if a donor could provide her with 3 packets of Drypers Wee Wee Dry Diapers - L (9 - 14kg) to meet her child's basic needs for about a month before she gets her pay next month. Feel free to contact me for more information about the diapers (I can provide picture of the diapers if required). I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me.
