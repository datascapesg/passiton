She stays in a rental flat.\n\nThe senior would bring out her mattress from the wardrobe and sleep on the floor. She stays in the living room and does not have much space to sleep. She reported back pain and falls as the mattress is thin, and as the mattress is on the floor without a frame, she would tend to fall during transferring between standing and sitting without proper support. \n\nIt would be great if the senior has a single size foldable mattress that has a thicker mattress, along with a taller frame where she can easily stand and sit. \n\nCan always reach out to me at 8126 2493 (Julia). \n\nCan refer to this link for reference. https://www.milliardbrands.com/products/signature-premier-folding-bed-twin-size-color-may-vary?srsltid=AfmBOorEtTzW-KGQ63QydNCRs49vz7xLU_I0edc9ya46ucBbTcu3ZHDg",
