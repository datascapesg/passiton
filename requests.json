As their regular cooking equipment has been spoilt, they have been using a steamboat cooker to do daily cooking. As the steamboat cooker uses a portable gas canister to operate, this family has been incurring higher costs for daily cooking. This is because they need to keep re-purchase a canister every 3 days. The ceramic cooker would help them to lower their costs of living.",
