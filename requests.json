As the family is still in the process of moving in and rebuilding stability after a period of housing insecurity, their financial resources are limited and focused on essential daily needs. A washing machine would be a crucial household item to support the family’s transition into stable housing, enabling the children to maintain proper hygiene and routine, while allowing the mother to better manage caregiving and work responsibilities. This donation would provide meaningful practical support and contribute significantly to the family’s dignity, stability, and ability to sustain their tenancy.",
