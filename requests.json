It would be very helpful if a donor could provide her with 3 green packets of 850g Dugro Original Stage 3 milk powder (client claims that this milk can be found at UStar Supermarket or Shopee) and 3 packets of Drypantz XL Baby Diapers - 32s (9 - 14kg) to meet her child's basic needs February 2023 as their current supply will run out early that month. This will give her some time to find a better paying job and apply for NECDC Growth Fund for assistance for milk and diapers for her youngest child.
