Her husband is residing in a nursing home due to caregiving needs, which contributed to Client's emotional distress. Her children are also facing financial difficulties with their own family, limiting their support for Client. Hence, Client tries to cook at home most of the time to meet her basic needs and ensure her physical well-being. Client hopes to receive a blender (i.e. to blend garlic, onion, etc.) to supplement her cooking at home, allowing more convenience and exploring other recipes for her cooking. Your kind support in facilitating this request would greatly help improve the Client's overall well-being. Thank you for your kind support.",
