To improve her quality of life, an electric mobility scooter would be beneficial for her to aid in her daily routines, especially since there is no one who is able to take care of her 24/7 at home. The family has also been under financial distress due to low income. Do contact Marilyn at 81214654 or marilyn@newlifestories.org.sg for further clarifications if needed, thank you so much!",
