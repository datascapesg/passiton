Besides my client (who is a single mother) and her 2 young daughters, her 80 years old frail and elderly grandmother is also staying with her. The damaged and “anytime can collapse” wardrobe poses a danger to her 2 very young children and her frail and elderly grandmother.

She has just received the keys to her rental flat and has shifted into it. However, as she has not found employment yet (she has started to send out resumes after slowing recovering from the grieving of her husband), she is unable to afford household items such as micro-oven and air fryer. \n\nShe needs the micro-oven and air fryer so that she can speed up her cooking especially on days when she is exhausted after doing household chores and does not the energy to cook a more elaborating meal. Also, at times the 2 children will be very hungry after returning home from their childcare centre and thus she needs to reduce her cooking time so that she can reduce the waiting time of food for her 2 hungry children. \n\nAdditionally cooking at home helps her to save money as she can reduce the frequency of eating outside food which is expensive and not so nutritious. She is not working so every amount saved counts.                \n\nIn view of the above, I hope that any kind donor can help to secure a micro-oven and air fryer for my client. My client is a resilient client, and her situation can be improved once she has secured a job. However, in the interim, she will need the kind assistance of PassITOn donors so that she can secure these 2 household appliances and thereby save some money (especially on the food expenses). \n\nSorry for the long appeal message and await your positive reply on helping my widowed client and her 2 children. \n\nThanks! \nRegards Mr Ho (9722 2721)",
