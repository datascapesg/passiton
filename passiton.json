However, as she has not found employment yet (she has started to send out resumes after slowing recovering from the grieving of her husband), she is unable to afford the more expensive household items such as fridge, washing machine etc.\n\nMy client informed me earlier today that her aunt has kindly donated a washing machine to her. Hence, she just needs a fridge now. The fridge is important since she can cook at home (instead of eating outside) using the frozen groceries and hence can save some money. She can also use the fridge to store the unfinished / leftover food and heat them for consumption the next day. This will again help her to save money on her food expenses. Those more easily perishable items such as milk (for her children), cheese etc can also be stored in the fridge as well. \n\nBesides the savings on food expenses, my client children can also be spared from eating outside regularly which might not be the healthier option for them. By cooking at home, my client can control the oil and other ingredients and will be able to cook less oily and more nutritious food for them.          \n\nIn view of the above, I hope that any kind donor can help to secure a fridge for my client. My client is a resilient client, and her situation can be improved once she has secured a job. However, in the interim, she will need the kind assistance of PassITOn donors so that she can secure a fridge and thereby save some money (especially on the food expenses). \n\nSorry for the long appeal message and await your positive reply on helping my widowed client and her 2 children. Thanks!\n\nRegards\nMr Ho (9722 2721)",

He has no family support and and relies solely on ComCare financial assistance to meet his basic daily living needs. He has a chronic heart condition which renders him permanently unfit to work.\n\nMy client’s only source of communication and entertainment is his mobile phone. Recently his phone is spoilt and is beyond repair. As he cannot afford to replace it, he has since become uncontactable, further deepening his social isolation. The phone is his only means of connection to the outside world.  A functional used smartphone would make a significant difference in improving his quality of life, safety, and emotional well-being.",
