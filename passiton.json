      "description": "Family of 4 has a teenager with special needs. The family is on financial assistance. Due to teenager's unique mood issues, he has difficulty taking the school bus during his hyper moods. The family previously coped by taking private hire during teenager's hyper moods that occur every month for approximately 2 weeks. However, these fares take up a significant proportion of the family's income. \nMother is a responsible lady who prioritises her children despite her several health conditions. She is also the full-time caregiver for the teenager with special needs.  \nTransport support for the family would be very helpful in reducing the stressors for this family and will allow the teenager to continue to have access to school during his hyper moods.",
