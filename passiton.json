The family is staying in a 2-Room HDB rental flat, and the household is receiving ComCare financial assistance for their household expenses. Mother has health issues while she tries to take on part time job.\n\nThe family has limited saving to purchase a new fridge and food would easily turned bad due to the lack of fridge. As such, family have been resorting to takeaway and instant noodles to manage the cost within their budget. This family would appreciate a kind donor to donate a fridge. Thank you. Please contact me, Family coach : Mythili at 62319489  (WhatsApp message or call) if you would like to make the donation. Thank you.",
