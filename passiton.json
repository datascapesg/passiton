Her doctor has advised her to consume milk consistently to help strengthen her bones.\nDue to her frail condition and loss of teeth, she is unable to eat much solid food, making milk an essential, long-term part of her diet. Unfortunately, the cost of milk remains a significant burden for her sole caregiver, who is of low income and struggling to keep up with the expenses.\nYour generosity in providing milk donations would offer continuous nourishment and comfort, helping her maintain her strength and improve her quality of life. The cappuccino flavor was chosen because the elderly individual dislikes plain milk, and the familiar coffee taste encourages her to drink it for essential nutrition.\nAny ongoing assistance would be deeply appreciated. Please contact us via WhatsApp at 96504736 if you have any questions.\nThank you for your kindness and support!",
