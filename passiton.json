      "description": "Family consists of a single mother and teenage daughter living together in a 1-room flat. Mother currently works 2 jobs as she also provides for her family back in Indonesia. Due to her tendency to hoard things to bring back for her family in Vietnam, it has compromised the air quality at home at times, which has triggered daughter's asthma. Mother is currently undergoing intervention to slowly cut down on the items she is hoarding for her family. However, an air purifier would help to maintain the air quality for the daughter while mother undergoes intervention, as daughter currently needs to even rely on steroid inhalants for relief.",

Apart from that she also has ongoing mental health needs, and to cope she has three cats that are resources for her to cope with her circumstances. Client would benefit from having a pet vacuum that can help pick up cat litter pellets, as she prioritises her cats’ wellbeing greatly but finds it increasingly challenging to keep up with ensuring home environment’s hygiene due to her deteriorating health. Thus having this would help her greatly in upkeeping her rental flat, as well as managing her physical health.Interested donors kindly contact Alexis at 6365 8751, thank you!",
