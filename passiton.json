These things are expensive and even though it is more than 4 years old, I still think it could potentially bring quite a lot of utility if deployed in common spaces.\n\nWill be engaging disposal services for this if there isn't a claim on the item by the date specified.",

It is still in good working condition, never broke down before in the past years. I would like to request for the VWO to help with the delivery or to provide a subsidized amount because I am also in the midst of a move on my own which is financially draining. I am the breadwinner of my two young siblings, we do not have any adults that we can depend on financially - and hence any help is appreciated. I would like to coordinate the move of the appliance between 31 Dec - 2nd of Jan. Thank you for reading this message.",
