      "description": "Client has a large family with 4 young children. The family has high living expenses, and client's husband is the sole breadwinner of the family. Due to some family issues, her husband is not providing for the children's basic needs and client has to do it on her own. Client is waiting to start a new part-time job. Client does not have enough cash at the moment to buy milk and diapers for her infant, and it would be very helpful if a donor could provide her with 2 stage 3 Friscolac Gold 1.8kg tins, as well as 3 packets of L Drypantz(Drypers) to meet her child's basic needs for now. Feel free to contact me for more information and feel free to donate any amount you are comfortable with. Thank you very much for helping the family.",
