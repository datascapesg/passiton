      "description": "My client is a 69 year old senior who lives with a co-tenant in a 1-room rental flat. He is in urgent need of a new wardrobe to store his clothes as his old wardrobe was bedbug infested and needs to be thrown away to prevent the bedbug infestation again. He is currently employed and has no source of income, relying on government payouts for his daily living expenses. Due to financial constraints, he does not have the means to purchase a new wardrobe. A simple wardrobe would greatly improve his living conditions, allowing him to keep his clothes clean. If you have a pre-loved wardrobe in good condition or would like to gift him with a new one, your generosity would make a lot of difference to his live. Thank you!",
