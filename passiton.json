      "description": "Mr Teo and Mr Koh (THK SGH @ Indus 79) \nMr Teo and Mr Koh, who are living at THK Seniors Group Home @ Indus 79, recently had their apartment fumigated for bed bugs. After the assessment and treatment, the vendor suggested that the existing mattresses and bedframe sets of both clients should be disposed of.  \n \nOn behalf of the clients, THKMC is seeking for a donation of 2 sets of single-sized bedframe and mattress to replace the existing sets which will help prevent the spread of bed-bug infestation. \n \nIf you know of someone who has the item for donation, please contact Mr Cheok at 8666 8635. The recipients are located at Indus Road Block 79 #09-475, Singapore 161079.  \n \nSince October 2011, THKMC was incorporated as a charity with an IPC status to provide multiple social and welfare services to the community at large. THKMC provides assistance to the Elderly, Families, Children & Youth, and Persons with Disabilities, through more than 70 programmes and services. \n \nTHK Elderly Services Division provides many programmes and services to serve the elderly in need – one of which includes THK Seniors Group Homes (SGH). THK SGHs are assisted living homes that aim to enable seniors to co-reside independently in designated HDB rental flats which are retrofitted with elder-friendly features.",
