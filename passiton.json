Mother is a home maker currently as she is caring for the kids. Family does not have enough money to buy enough milk and diapers for the toddlers as they need to focus a bit more on the newborn. As such, for now, FSC is wondering if there are any kind donors who can support the family with milk and diapers for 3 months (3 tins of Lactogen 3 1.75kg, 4 packets of Huggies Dry Comfort Pants - XL) per month. If you are open to support any amount (even if lesser), can still email me to find out more. Thank you!",
