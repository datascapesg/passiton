      "description": "The family is a low income family with 3 children: 1 in primary school and 2 young children aged 2 and 3 (not in childcare yet), and only father is working as a mover but does not earn much. Mother is a home maker currently as she is pregnant with another child. Family does not have enough money to buy enough milk and diapers every month now as since mother is was pregnant, it has been hard for her to always cook and family needs to travel to NUH from Punggol monthly on cab (back and forth) due to mother's motion sickness and she is unable to tahan taking public transport for the whole trip. As such, for now, FSC is wondering if there are any kind donors who can support the family with milk and diapers for 3 months (3 tins of Lactogen 3 1.75kg, 4 packets of Huggies Dry Comfort Pants - XL) per month. If you are open to support any amount (even if lesser), can still email me to find out more. Thank you!",
