In order to get a replacement of NRIC, a registered address is required and client is rough sleep.\n\nAdditionally, client does not own a mobile phone, making it difficult for professionals to contact him or for him to access essential services.\n\nA smartphone would be a crucial resource for client, enabling him to access the Singpass app, where he could retrieve important personal information such as his bank account and CPF details. \n\nReceiving a smartphone would significantly help client overcome these barriers, providing him with a vital tool to pursue his employment goals and work toward improving his circumstances.",
