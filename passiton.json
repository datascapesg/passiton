He is in urgent need of a new wardrobe to store his clothes as his old wardrobe was bedbug infested and needs to be thrown away to prevent the bedbug infestation again. He is currently employed and has no source of income, relying on government payouts for his daily living expenses. Due to financial constraints, he does not have the means to purchase a new wardrobe. A simple wardrobe would greatly improve his living conditions, allowing him to keep his clothes clean. If you have a pre-loved wardrobe in good condition or would like to gift him with a new one, your generosity would make a lot of difference to his live. Thank you!",

      "description": "This is a family of 4, with two children who have special needs age 3 and 8. The 8-year-old child wears diapers and faces challenges in toilet training due to sensory and communication needs. He uses 6 diapers per day. The mother is the main caregiver while father works as a food delivery rider (there is a reduced income as the phone is not working). The high caregiving needs make it difficult to maintain employment and cause significant financial strain. Your support for diapers will offer much-needed relief while they wait for ComCare financial assistance approval. If you would like to support the family, please email us at suryani_rahim@awwa.org.sg. Brand: Dr. P Pants Adult Diapers XL or TENA Pants Super Unisex Adult Diapers - XL Quantity: 6-8 packs Thank you for your generosity.",
