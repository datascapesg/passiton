      "description": "Client has a large family with 5 young children. The family has high living expenses, and parents' low income is not sufficient to provide for the children's basic needs. Currently, parents are trying to get their oldest daughter to start working (she is 16 and dropped out of school) so that the family's finances can be more stable. However, they are unable to buy enough milk and diapers for now as finances are very tight for them and it would be very helpful if a donor could provide the family with some milk powder and diapers for about 2 months to ease their financial burden and ensure their younger kids' basic needs are still met while they work out some plans to stabilize the family financially. The family requires 5 tins of Grow Stage 3 900g and 2 packets of Dugro Stage 4 for 2 of their children. They also require 3 packets each of XL and XXL Huggies Silver Pantz. Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me too, and you can donate any amount that you are comfortable with. Thank you very much for helping the family!",
