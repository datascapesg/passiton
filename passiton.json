As such, she needs to use the TPG app to make calls, in which she has difficulty accessing which limits her call making.\n\nClient hopes to be able to self-reliant and continue working as she is still in good general health. Hence, she hopes to have a TPG compatible phone which she is unable to afford due to her unemployment and limited savings. Thank you very much for your consideration and attention!",
