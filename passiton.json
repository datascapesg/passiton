The family requires 4 tins of S26 Stage 3 1.6kg and 2 packets of Dugro Stage 4 for their children. They also require 6 packets of XXL Huggies Silver Pantz. The milk is more urgent as family still has some diapers at home. Feel free to contact me for more information. I will only be able to reply on weekdays office hours. Feel free to email me too, and you can donate any amount that you are comfortable with (you can order online for it to be sent to the family). Thank you very much for helping the family!",

      "description": "Low income family of 6 is currently trying to cut costs by weaning their baby from formula milk to fresh milk and toilet training her. Due to their tight finances, they have difficulties buying milk and diapers this month and as such would require a one time off milk and diapers support. Family requires 3 packs of Dugro stage 4 (green packaging) 850g, 3, 3 packets of 6 of marigold chocolate flavoured milk and 3 packets of Drypers Drypantz XL. You can donate any amount you are comfortable with too and reach out to me through email for pictures of the items for clarification if needed. Family is ok if you would like to order online or send it to the FSC as they live nearby and can pick it up. Thank you for supporting them!",
