If anyone has a working laptop to donate or knows of resources that could help, it would make a huge difference in her journey.\n\nPlease reach out if you’re able to assist. Your kindness and generosity would mean the world to her.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nSocial Worker Edlin: 69506713 (Whatsapp)",
