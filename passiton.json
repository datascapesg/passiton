With no financial support from him, she works in the food and beverage industry to provide for her family. While her job offers some flexibility for caregiving, her income remains unstable, making it difficult to meet their daily household needs.\n\nDespite these challenges, she keeps her home tidy, ensures her children attend school and does her best to ensure her children's well-being. With the fasting month and Hari Raya approaching, the family faces increased financial strain due to rising costs of necessities. \n\nTo support them during this period, we are seeking donations of essential food items such as Rice, Cooking oil, Sugar crackers, Similac Isomil Plus Milk Powder, and Drypers Drypantz (Size XL).\n\nYour generosity can help ease this motherâs burden, allowing her to focus on caring for her children without the added worry of providing food and essentials.

It has made it difficult for her to secure a stable income and financially taxing to afford these essential appliances. Without a fridge, she struggles to store fresh food, which causes her to rely on processed foods, that may not fully meet her dietary needs. This affects her overall health and well-being, especially given her existing medical conditions. Similarly, not having a washing machine makes laundry physically demanding and relying on external laundry services can be costly and difficult to manage regularly, further straining her limited finances, and adding to her daily challenges. \n\nA donated washing machine and fridge would significantly improve her quality of life, allowing her to manage her household more independently and focus on her well-being. We would appreciate if you could source for a working washing machine or fridge that can be passed on to client to meet her needs.",
